                    <p>As users went through the flow their screens, interactions and audio were recorded. They were given tasks to complete and were prompted to answer pre-determined questions. The results showed that overall, younger demographics found the webform very easy to use but older demographics ran into accessibility issues. We made iterations to increase usability and determined KPI's to track our products success.</p>

                <p>Know what will work and what won't, means that you must work closely with your developers. A change that may seem simple to me, may have a catastrophic ripple effect, or simply take too much time resulting in us missing deadlines. They will have helpful tips and possible solutions with new perspective that will ultimately result in a better product.</p>
                <br>

                <p><b>Accessibility for all age demographics</b></p>
                <p>The initial iteration of this product worked great for the younger demographic, but once we tested the older demographic, we noticed a lot of visual accessibly issues arising. Quickly we realized some components features, like contrast, were too low and we had to address them to appeal to our wider audience of users.</p>
                <br>

                <p><b>Wide demographic and white label equals super simplified design</b></p>
                <p>Hostopia's partners and their users trickle down to the widest possible demographic. We discovered that keeping our product as simple, clean and as straightforward as possible was the way to go for the best user experience.</p>
