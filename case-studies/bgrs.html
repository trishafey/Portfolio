                    <p>We continued to iterate by conducting interviews with users that utilized various assistive technology. We paid close attention to colours, contrast, text sizes, clickable areas, proper coding using H1, H2, H3 etc and aria labeling. This enabled us to tailor the design to a wider target audience by following WCAG AA standards.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The entire UI and UX needed an overhaul, and through preliminary research we identified the employee's top goals. We removed unused widgets from the previous design, and streamlined the task completion process. In order to easily intake information and ensure tasks were being monitored and completed, we introduced home, list and calendar views. We condensed "reminders", "personal reminders", "tasks" and "milestones" to tasks and milestones. Once communication was streamlined in this manner, employees and BGRS consultants were again using the dashboard and leaving email as a secondary form of communication.</p>

Communication was streamlined and employees and BGRS consultants were once again using the dashboard and leaving email behind. One of the most difficult parts was merging the flow of the employee, consultant and client views of the dashboards with our existing structure seamlessly. The focus on accessibility gave me new and extremely useful insight to users whom I had not had the opportunity to interview before.</p>

                <p><b>Always fight for good UX</b></p>
                <p>I was lucky to have a large say in the outcome of the project. The UI was going through an update for the entire website which provided a lot of flexibility for new components. Some developers were reluctant to introduce new custom components but fighting for what I believe is essential to having a good user experience led to a final product that ultimately tested well.</p>
                <br>

                <p><b>Adapting to changing requirements</b></p>
                <p>The new dashboard generated a ton of excitement within the company, but our ambition blinded us and delayed the launch. New timelines, resourcing issues, and reprioritization meant the scope of the project was constantly changing. I had to adapt to those changes and still deliver the best possible design in time with tight deadlines.</p>
                <br>

                <p><b>Accessibility is underrated</b></p>
                <p>According to the Pew Internet Project, survey conducted by <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2A7B7B; text-decoration: underline;">Princeton Survey Research Associates International, Jan. 2011</a>, 54% of adults living with a disability go online. <a href="https://www.census.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2A7B7B; text-decoration: underline;">The Census Bureau on July 25, 2012</a> found that 38.3 million (12.6%) have a severe disability. We partnered with <a href="https://makeitfable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2A7B7B; text-decoration: underline;">Fable</a> and through interviews learned about different types of assistive technology. Users provided us with demonstrations of how they used their technology as well as testing the usability of our new dashboard features. This was extremely insightful. Such things as large clickable areas, colours, contrast, text size, scroll bars play and surprisingly coding proper "H1" headings proved to provide a far superior user experience.</p>
